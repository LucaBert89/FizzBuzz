# FooBar
FooBar exercise using for loop and recursive function.
 
Print the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive, each on their own line.

If, however, the number is a multiple of three then print Foo instead, and if the number is a multiple of five then print Bar.

For numbers which are multiples of both three and five then print FooBar.
